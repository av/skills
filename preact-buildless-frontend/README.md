# preact-buildless-frontend

Build-less ESM frontends that run directly in the browser without bundlers. Use this skill when creating static frontends, SPAs without build tools, prototypes, or when the user explicitly wants no Vite/Webpack/bundler. Covers import maps, CDN imports, cache-busting, hash routing, and performance patterns.
